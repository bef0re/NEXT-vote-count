# NEXT-vote-count
Dirty python script that scrapes some very specific things from a sharepoint website, regexes HT̳̫M̩͇͝L̜̱̫͖̩, and works 95% of the time.

To retrieve the scores:

1. Fill in your username and password in scrape.py
2. Run scrape.py with python3
3. Run score.py with python3

Fails on 5% of the forms and ignores them. Feel free to fix.
